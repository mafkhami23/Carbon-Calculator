# GHG Commute Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to commuting habits. The analysis is based on survey data that collects information about commuting modes, distances, and vehicle types.

## Overview

The `GHG_Commute.ipynb` notebook processes survey data to analyze the environmental impact of different commuting practices. It is aimed at understanding how different transportation modes contribute to GHG emissions and how working from home affects overall emissions.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The notebook includes code to clean and transform survey data for analysis.
- **Analysis of Commuting Modes**: Evaluate different commuting modes such as single occupancy vehicles, carpooling, public transport, electric vehicles, biking, and remote work.
- **Distance and Frequency Analysis**: Assess the impact of commuting distances and frequency on GHG emissions.
- **Vehicle Type Impact**: Understand the impact of different vehicle types (e.g., electric, hybrid, gas) on emissions.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` (if visualization is included)
- `jupyter`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
